# Users and permissions

## Users

The admin, made at setup, may do everything. Add other people under **Settings → Users**, giving each only what they
need. Nobody can give a permission they don't have, and only the admin can change the admin's account. Removing
someone signs them out and revokes their API keys; what they asked for stays.

Anyone can change their own username and password from the account menu at the top right. A new password signs them
out everywhere else.

## What each permission allows

| Permission | Allows |
| --- | --- |
| **Browse** | Seeing the library, the catalogue, what's being fetched and what's running |
| **Request** | Asking for music to be fetched into the library, and ignoring albums and songs |
| **Listen** | Playing music, fetching songs to listen to without adding them, and having playlists |
| **Review and match** | Approving, matching, excluding, deferring and hiding files on Review |
| **Format** | Rewriting files' tags and covers, and moving them; choosing album and song covers; looking for a song's lyrics |
| **Remove music** | Deleting music from the library, or hiding it |
| **Scan** | Scanning the library, and pausing, cancelling and reordering tasks |
| **Settings and plugins** | Changing settings and plugins, and reading the log |
| **API keys and webhooks** | Making API keys for apps, and managing webhooks |
| **Manage users** | Adding, changing and removing other users |

Someone who just listens needs Browse and Listen. Buttons for what someone may not do don't show.

## API keys

Apps use a key from **Settings → API**. A key belongs to whoever made it and can never do more than they may: if their
permissions shrink, or they're removed, so does the key. **Everything you may do** gives a key all its owner's
permissions, now and later. See the [client guide](../client-guide.md) for the API itself.

## A lost admin password

Start Melodex once with `Melodex__ResetLogin=true`, open the web app and set a new password, then remove the variable
and restart. Other users, and everyone's keys, are kept. Anyone else who forgets theirs can have a new one set by
someone who may manage users.
