# Import worker (beets)

The import worker is the only component that writes the music library. It runs [beets](https://beets.io) in its
own container, in `beets-worker/`. The core calls it after a fetched file passes verification.

Unlike retrieval plugins it's part of Navidex, not a plugin: there is one, and its API is internal. It's written
down here so it can be swapped or debugged.

## Why beets doesn't guess

By the time a file reaches the worker, Navidex knows which MusicBrainz release it belongs to and which recording
it is. The worker pins beets to that release (`search_ids`) and takes it whatever beets' match score says. It then
checks every file landed on the recording Navidex named, and refuses the import if not. So beets never files a
song under the wrong album because the tags looked close enough.

Navidex is the library's database, so beets' own library only exists for one import at a time. Nothing beets
remembers can disagree with Navidex. One side effect: `%aunique{}` never adds anything, because beets sees no other
albums to tell apart.

## `POST /v1/import`

```json
{
  "stagingDirectory": "0199f0c2-…",
  "release": { "musicBrainzId": "76df3287-…", "title": "Dummy", "artist": "Portishead", "date": "1994-08-22", "trackCount": 11 },
  "files": [
    { "path": "track.opus", "recordingId": "145f5c43-…", "trackId": null, "title": "Glory Box", "artist": "Portishead", "disc": 1, "position": 11 }
  ],
  "destinationDirectory": null,
  "pathTemplate": "$albumartist/$album%aunique{}/$track $title",
  "musicBrainzServer": "https://musicbrainz.org"
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `stagingDirectory` | The job's folder, relative to the staging volume (`/staging`). |
| `release` | The edition the files belong to. Its MusicBrainz ID pins the match. |
| `files` | Each file, relative to the staging folder, with the recording it is and its place on the release. |
| `destinationDirectory` | A folder relative to the library to put the files in, instead of the template's. Navidex sets it when you already own part of the album, so new tracks join the files you have wherever they live. Only the file name comes from the template. |
| `pathTemplate` | A [beets path format](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/pathformat.html), set under Settings → Fetching. |
| `musicBrainzServer` | The server Navidex's MusicBrainz plugin uses, so a mirror applies to imports too. |

Steps:

1. Copy the files into a scratch folder and tag them with what Navidex sent (title, artist, album, disc and
   track number, MusicBrainz recording, track and release IDs), so beets maps each one onto the right track.
2. Run a beets import pinned to the release, writing tags in place.
3. Check each file matched its recording.
4. Move each file to `library/<template path>`, or `library/<destinationDirectory>/<file name>`. If a file is
   already there, add `.1`, `.2` and so on before the extension, as beets does.
5. Delete the staged originals.

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "source": "track.opus",
      "path": "Portishead/Dummy/11 Glory Box.opus",
      "durationSeconds": 305.573,
      "format": "Opus",
      "tags": { "title": "Glory Box", "mb_trackid": "145f5c43-…", "mb_albumid": "76df3287-…", "isrc": "GBAQT9400066" }
    }
  ]
}
```

`tags` holds the beets fields that have values: titles, artists, track and disc numbers, dates, label, catalogue
number, ISRC, country, media, album type and the MusicBrainz IDs.

Errors are `{ "error": "message", "code": "..." }`: `422 import-failed` when beets can't import the files (for
example MusicBrainz didn't return the release, or a file didn't match its recording), and `400` for a malformed
request. Navidex shows the message on the Activity page and marks the request failed, without trying other
plugins, because another copy of the song would fail the same way.

## `POST /v1/delete`

Deletes files from the library, for removing an artist, album or track from the Library page.

```json
{ "paths": ["Portishead/Dummy/01 Mysterons.opus", "Portishead/Dummy/02 Sour Times.opus"] }
```

Each path is relative to the library. After the files go, so does any folder left holding nothing but artwork,
playlists, rip logs or notes (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.cue`, `.log`, `.m3u`, `.nfo`, `.txt` and the like), then its parent
the same way, up to the library itself. A path outside the library is refused.

Response `200`, listing a file that was already gone as deleted:

```json
{ "deleted": ["Portishead/Dummy/01 Mysterons.opus"], "failed": [{ "path": "Portishead/Dummy/02 Sour Times.opus", "error": "Permission denied" }] }
```

## `POST /v1/format`

Rewrites files already in the library, for formatting an artist, album, track or the whole library. Navidex works
out every value from its catalogue; the worker only writes them.

```json
{
  "files": [
    { "path": "incoming/glory box.flac", "tags": { "title": "Glory Box", "album": "Dummy", "track": "11", "date": "1994-08-22" }, "artwork": "cover" }
  ],
  "artwork": { "cover": { "data": "<base64>" } },
  "pathTemplate": "$albumartist/$album%aunique{}/$track $title"
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `files[].tags` | Tags to write, by beets field name. The rest stay as they are, and an empty value clears one. Navidex writes `title`, `artist`, `album`, `albumartist`, `track`, `tracktotal`, `disc`, `disctotal`, `date` and `original_date` (as `yyyy`, `yyyy-MM` or `yyyy-MM-dd`), `country`, `media`, `albumtype`, `label`, `catalognum`, `isrc` and the `mb_*` IDs; any other name fails that file. |
| `files[].artwork` | The key of an image in `artwork` to embed as the front cover, replacing what's there. Omit it to leave the embedded art. |
| `files[].removeArtwork` | Take the embedded art out. |
| `artwork` | Images by key, base64, so an album's files share one copy. |
| `pathTemplate` | Move each file to where this path format puts it, going by its new tags, as an import would. Omit it to leave files where they are. |

A moved file never overwrites another: `.1`, `.2` and so on go before the extension. Once a folder holds no music,
its artwork and the like follow the music to its new folder, and the folder goes, then any parent left empty.

Response `200`, a result for each file in order. A file that couldn't be formatted, for example because it's gone
or outside the library, says why, and the rest carry on:

```json
{ "files": [{ "path": "incoming/glory box.flac", "newPath": "Portishead/Dummy/11 Glory Box.flac", "size": 72970 }, { "path": "gone.flac", "error": "It isn't in the music folder any more." }] }
```

## `GET /v1/health`

`{ "status": "healthy" | "unhealthy", "message": "..." }`. Unhealthy when the staging or library volume isn't
mounted, or the library isn't writable.

## Running

One import runs at a time, because beets' configuration is global. Mount the staging volume at `/staging` and the
library at `/music`, and run the container as the user that owns the library. Beets reads no config file, only its
defaults plus the settings above.
