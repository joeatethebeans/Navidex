| `sandbox` | A throwaway stack (Navidrome, Melodex, the beets worker and both plugins) over a copy of the test library |

## Building and testing

With the .NET 10 SDK:

```bash
python3 tools/testlib/generate.py   # once: the gate test needs the test library, and is skipped without it
dotnet test
```

To try things out without a real library, see [testing.md](testing.md):

```bash
sandbox/sandbox.sh up
```

To build and run the whole stack from source with Docker:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build
```

Schema changes need a migration:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> -p src/Melodex.Core -o Data/Migrations
```

## Releases

Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). The version lives in `Directory.Build.props`. To release:

1. Move the *Unreleased* section of `CHANGELOG.md` under a heading for the new version, such as
   `## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-20`, and set `<Version>` in `Directory.Build.props` to match.
2. Tag the commit `v<version>` and push the tag.

The release workflow builds the images, publishes them to the GitHub Container Registry as `<version>`,
`<major>.<minor>` and `latest`, and makes a GitHub release with the changelog's notes.
