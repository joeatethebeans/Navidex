# Testing without a real library

Navidex is developed against a generated test library and a throwaway Navidrome, so nothing touches a real
music collection until you choose to point it at one.

## The test library

`tools/testlib` builds a small library from real MusicBrainz data, with a known answer for what's owned and what's
missing.

```bash
python3 tools/testlib/generate.py
```

This writes `tools/testlib/out/music/` (85 silent files, about 10 MB) and `tools/testlib/out/expected.json`, the
answer key. It needs ffmpeg and the Python `mutagen` package, and runs offline in about ten seconds.

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `scenario.json` | What to build: which artists, which editions are owned, how each album is tagged, and the stray files |
| `catalogue.json` | A committed snapshot of the MusicBrainz data the library is built from |
| `fetch_catalogue.py` | Refreshes the snapshot (about 70 requests, at MusicBrainz's one request a second) |
| `generate.py` | Builds the files and the answer key from the two JSON files |

The scenarios, two artists with deep and messy discographies (Portishead: 90 release groups; Daft Punk: 217):

| Album | Format | Tags | Exercises |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dummy | FLAC | Full MusicBrainz | The easy path |
| Portishead | MP3 | Full MusicBrainz | Owned album with 2 tracks missing |
| Roseland NYC Live | M4A | Basic only | Fuzzy matching; a live album that's owned although live albums are hidden from the missing view |
| Discovery | MP3 | Basic + ISRC | ISRC matching without MusicBrainz IDs |
| Homework | FLAC | Basic only | Fuzzy matching through a messy folder name, shouting, a version suffix and a changed artist credit |
| Random Access Memories (10th anniversary) | M4A | Full MusicBrainz | Two-disc deluxe edition owning the album, with one disc-2 bonus track missing |
| Three strays | MP3 | Various | A wrong-length "Glory Box", a track not in the catalogue, and an untagged file: all go to review |

Tags are written the way beets and Picard write them for each format: Vorbis comments, ID3v2.4 with a UFID for the
recording ID, and MP4 freeform atoms.

### The answer key

`expected.json` says, for each file, the match method Navidex should use (named as in `MatchMethod`) and the
recording, edition and album it belongs to; stray files say `Unmatched`. For each artist, it lists the owned albums
(complete or with their missing tracks), the missing albums the default filters show, and how many missing albums
the filters hide.

Each missing album also says whether it's `coveredWhenFetchedOnce`: every track of one of its official editions is
owned on other albums. With the default `duplicateTracks` setting (fetch a song once, keep it in the album) those
albums are covered, not missing; with `keepBoth` they're missing.

The default filters are in `scenario.json` under `policy`. The plan names live albums, compilations, remixes, demos
and soundtracks as hidden. Real data also has interviews, mixtapes and DJ mixes, so the policy hides any release
group with a secondary type. It also hides groups with only bootleg releases, such as Daft Punk's *Leftovers*.

### The gate test

`LibraryGateTests` scans the test library through the real core and checks every file's match and every album's
status against the answer key, in both duplicate modes. It replays recorded MusicBrainz responses from
`tests/fixtures/musicbrainz`, so it runs offline in seconds. After changing what the MusicBrainz plugin or the matcher
asks for, record them again (about ten minutes, at one request a second) and commit the fixtures:

```bash
NAVIDEX_RECORD=1 dotnet test --filter LibraryGateTests
```

It's skipped if the library hasn't been generated. CI generates it first.

## The sandbox

`sandbox/sandbox.sh` runs Navidrome 0.64.2 and Navidex side by side over the test library, with podman or docker:

```bash
sandbox/sandbox.sh up
```

This generates the library if it isn't there, builds the Navidex image if needed, starts both containers on a
private network, creates a Navidrome admin, scans, and reports what Navidrome indexed.

- Navidrome: http://localhost:4533. The user is `admin`; the password is generated into `sandbox/.env` on first run.
- Navidex: http://localhost:8787
- Inside the network, Navidex reaches Navidrome at `http://navidrome:4533`, ready for the Phase 2 connector.

The music folder is mounted read-only in both containers. `sandbox/sandbox.sh scan` rescans after you regenerate,
`status` reports, and `down` removes the containers and their data.

## Moving on to a real library

Phase 1 only reads the library, so the final check that the missing view is right can run against your real files
read-only (Compose mounts the music folder `:ro`). Files without MusicBrainz IDs will match less reliably until
they're adopted with beets. To try the adopt step without risk, run it on a copy.
