# Changelog

What changed in each release of Melodex. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## Unreleased

Everything on the way to 1.0.

### New

- **Melodex**: Navidex has a new name, a logo and a pink theme. Installs from before upgrade in place; see
  [upgrading](docs/guide/upgrading.md#from-navidex).
- **Themes**: pink, green, blue, grey, purple and amber, each light or dark or following your device, a black mode
  for OLED screens, and high contrast with colour-blind-safe status colours. Each user chooses their own under
  Settings → Appearance.
- **The guide**, in `docs/guide` and in the web app under Settings → Help.
- **Users**: accounts for everyone, with permissions to browse, request, listen, review, format, remove, scan, change
  settings, make API keys and manage users. Everyone signs in; Remember me keeps a browser signed in for 30 days.
- **API keys** belong to the user who made them and can do no more than they may.
- **Review**: exclude, defer or hide files, and put them back from the lists at the bottom.
- **Your own music**: excluded files show as their tags say, with their own artist and album pages and covers.
- **Formatting**: rewrite files' tags, covers and folders from the catalogue, for a track, album, artist or the whole
  library.
- **Scan menu**: match unmatched files again, or everything, and format the library.
- **Tasks** can be paused, cancelled and reordered; tracks have pages of their own.
- **About**, under Settings: the version, what it was built from, and links to GitHub.
- **Missing view**: each kind of release (live, compilations, remixes, demos, soundtracks, bootlegs and the rest) has
  its own choice of Show, Hide or **New songs only**, which lists a release just for the songs found nowhere else.
- **File metadata**: your files' tags and their cover art can each be preferred on their own.
- **Search remembers**: the last search, its results and where you'd scrolled stay for a while after you leave the
  Search page (5 minutes by default; each user sets their own under Settings → Appearance).
- **Choosing a cover**: an album's or song's cover can be picked from every release it's on, its files' own, or a picture
  you upload. It's written into the files straight away (and an album's folder gets it as `cover.jpg`), and Melodex
  shows it from then on.
- **Getting your library ready**: just after starting, the top bar and the Library page say the library's lists are
  being worked out, which takes a while the first time on a big library.

### Fixed

- Browsers could keep an old copy of the web app's page, showing *Loading Navidex* and failing to change the theme.
- The ownership meters and legend use brighter colours in light themes.
- The Log page's Info, Warnings and Errors toggles have tick boxes in their own colours, not black.
- Status pills on Downloads, Activity and elsewhere have room to breathe.
- The Library page's controls wait while a view loads, so changes don't pile up behind it.
- *Fetch once, keep it with the smallest release* now does that: a song fetched on its own goes with a single before an
  album. It used to behave as *keep it with the main album*.

### Changed

- The library's lists of artists, albums and tracks are kept on disk, so they show at once after a restart, and carry
  an ETag, so switching between them only downloads what changed. Views already loaded show at once.
- Settings → General reads more easily: songs on more than one release are described for every kind of release, and
  numbers have − and + buttons that keep every line the same height.
- `LibrarySettings` has `showing`, `preferFileTags` and `preferFileCovers` in place of `shownTypes`,
  `hideSecondaryTypes`, `hideUnofficial` and `preferFileMetadata`; saved settings carry over.
- API keys start `mdx_`; `ndx_` keys still work.
- Webhook headers are `Melodex-Signature`, `Melodex-Event` and `Melodex-Delivery`.
- The local network is no longer let in without signing in.
